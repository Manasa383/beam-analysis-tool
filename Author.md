About the Author,
I’m Manasa, an aspiring engineer whose fascination with bridges began when I first wondered how such massive structures could balance strength and elegance. That early spark grew into a passion for structural mechanics and problem-solving, which led me to create the Beam Analysis Tool. By combining programming with engineering, I’ve transformed abstract ideas like shear force, bending moment, and deflection into an interactive tool that makes learning both practical and visual. Projects like this reflect what excites me most about engineering: blending curiosity with creativity, turning theory into application, and building tools that not only deepen my own understanding but also inspire others to explore.

# Beam Analysis Tool

An **interactive Streamlit web app** that calculates **shear force, bending moment, and deflection** for a simply supported beam under various loading conditions.  
This project demonstrates **structural analysis concepts** and provides a visual, beginner-friendly way to learn beam mechanics.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Interactive UI** built with Streamlit
- 🏗 **Supports multiple loading cases** (point load, UDL, combination)
- 📈 **Generates shear force and bending moment diagrams**
- 🔢 Calculates **maximum bending stress and deflection**
- 💡 Ideal for **engineering students and educators**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Streamlit** (for UI)
- **NumPy / SymPy** (for calculations)
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** (for graphs)
